# RubyOnLakes
Website for RubyOnLakes event.

Until we run website there are all details:


In shortcut there is an idea to organize a little cruise/conference event in August.
#Schedule
Between 9-12 AM we have some talks, then we go sail to next port, where we have 30-45m LT session
and then we have party. We sleep on boats.

#CFP
Cmon! Lets make speakers list together.
For now we have: (alhpabetical order):
 - Andrzej Krzywda -  'when rails presenters are a smell and what to do about it'
 - Maciej Aniserowicz (guest from .Net community) - CQRS
 - Norbert Wójtowicz - "We need to talk. It's not you, it's your application architecture sensibilities."
 - Wojciech Piekutowski - TBA

 
 Lightin talks:
 - Michał Matyas - 'Small experiment to (hopefully) improve test coverage'
 - Paweł Kondzior - 'Something about rust, if I'm allowed to talk non ruby things '
 - Adam Piotrowski - Basics of Sailing theory

#Route
  Sztynort ->  Węgorzewo -> Sztynort
#Date
  29.08.2015- 31.08.2015
#Cost
  Cost is 1762zł per boat. Those boats are designed for 10 people, but if realy focus on comfort and stuff because f.e. you want to take your wife & children then you should go with max 8 ppl per boat.
At Sztynort and Węgorzewo we will rent a place there we can have presentations. That is 100zł/hour so i assume we should get 500zł-600zł for that . 
Another cost are port-payments that is about 100zł per boat for whole cruise.
And last cost is deposit that we should get back after cruise if we won't destroy our boats ;D (about 1000zł per boat).
If we won't collect enough ruby-skippers than we have to hire some , then cost will be a little bit higher.
<b>So for person whole cost should be about 250-350zł</b> - depends on how many people go to 1 boat. + <b>deposit</b>
# CoC
Salining ethics rules - also that is not official event but holidays with friends from community ;]

*****************************
And the most important thing:
This is not conference.
I'm not a organization.
That is a community event made by community for community.
When we get advance i collect it to my personal account and handle it on my own - so i won't give you any invoices or stuff - we do it like friends.
If you are whole company that really want to have invoice for boats we can handle it by redirecting you company directly for
boat-rentals-company and you will rent it from them with invoice (but i`m not sure about 30% discount that we already have then).
I don't know what is the limit of the boats count for now, but i assume 50ppl is max that i can handle with my organization skills ;]
Any questions? Prv me there, on skype: pan_sarin, or by email .
